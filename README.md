# vimacs
Its just emacs + evil mode (not doom emacs) with no pesky backup and auto save files.

Pick ONE directory to place this file. 

Just slap this file into either of these directory
1. ~/.emacs.d/init.el
2. ~/.config/emacs/init.el

Or you might want it to just throw it in you $HOME directory.
(rename "init.el" to ".emacs" or ".emacs.el")
1. ~/.emacs
2. ~/.emacs.el
